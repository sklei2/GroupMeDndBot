  All the the commands I know and how to execute them! Also this is the command you just ran, why are you reading this?

/roll [times]d[number_of_faces]
  I can roll a die any number of times and give you the output of it. 
  [times] => Number of times to roll the die.
  [number_of_faces] => the max value on the die face.
  EX: '/roll 1d20' means I will roll a 20 sided die, one time.
