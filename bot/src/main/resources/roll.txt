/roll [times]d[number_of_faces] [+ [times]d[number_of_faces]]
  I can roll a die any number of times and give you the output of it. I can even handle multiple die types!
  [times] => Number of times to roll the die.
  [number_of_faces] => the max value on the die face.
  EX: '/roll 1d20' means I will roll one 20 sided die and give you the value.
  EX: '/roll 1d6 + 2d4' means I will roll one 6 side + two 4 sided dice, and add them together.
